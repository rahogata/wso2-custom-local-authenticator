### WSO2 Custom Local Authenticator Gradle OSGi Bundle

This project has been developed by referring to official documentation for [Writing a Custom Local Authenticator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS530/Writing+a+Custom+Local+Authenticator).

This project uses Gradle as build tool instead of Maven. The intention is to have a template project that requires WSO2 OSGi bundles to be built using Gradle instead of Maven where Gradle is the main build tool used by the company.
